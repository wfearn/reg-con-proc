(&ldquo;F<I>d</I>G&rdquo;), solely in its capacity as the Limbach Holders&rsquo; Representative under the Merger Agreement, providing
for the merger of a newly formed subsidiary of the Company (&ldquo;Merger Sub&rdquo;) with and into Limbach, with Limbach surviving
the merger as a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company. The transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement are collectively
referred to as the &ldquo;Business Combination.&rdquo;</P>

with F<I>d</I>G, which owns approximately 80% of the outstanding membership interests of Limbach, pursuant to which, among other
things, F<I>d</I>G has agreed to vote its Limbach membership interests in favor of approval of the Merger Agreement and the transactions

of the Merger Agreement, the Company and Limbach&rsquo;s current chief executive officer, Charles A. Bacon, III, entered into an
Employment Agreement (the &ldquo;Employment Agreement&rdquo;), providing for employment of Mr. Bacon as the chief executive officer
of the Company following the Business Combination.</P>

to be paid by the Company to the holders of membership interests and holders of options to acquire membership interests of Limbach
will be an aggregate of $60 million, comprised of (a) between $35 million and $45 million in cash (the &ldquo;Cash Consideration&rdquo;),
(b) between 1.5 million and 2.5 million shares of the Company&rsquo;s common stock, par value $0.0001 per share (&ldquo;Merger
Shares&rdquo;), and (c) up to 666,667 warrants to purchase one share of the Company&rsquo;s common stock at an exercise price of
$12.50 (&ldquo;Merger Warrants&rdquo;). The amount of Cash Consideration to be paid, number of Merger Shares to be issued and number
of Merger Warrants to be issued (if any) to the holders of the outstanding membership interests and holders of options to acquire
membership interests of Limbach will be based upon the amount of cash remaining in the trust account holding the proceeds of the
Company&rsquo;s initial public offering (the &ldquo;Trust Account&rdquo;) after giving effect to any redemptions of the Company&rsquo;s
shares of common stock in connection with the stockholder vote to approve the Business Combination.</P>

purchase membership interests of Limbach then outstanding will be settled for a mixture of the Cash Consideration, Merger
Shares and Merger Warrants, if any. Limbach optionholders may elect to be substantially cashed-out (the
&ldquo;Cash-out Optionholders&rdquo;) or participate pro rata with the holders of Limbach membership interests to the extent
of the implied value of the membership interests underlying the options (the &ldquo;Participating Optionholders&rdquo;).
Options held by Cash-out Optionholders will be converted into the right to receive (a) an amount of cash equal to the
aggregate implied value of the membership interests underlying such options (assuming the full exercise of all outstanding
Limbach options for cash), <I>less</I> the exercise price of such options, <I>less</I> $1,000, and (b) 100 Merger Shares,
each with a nominal value of $10.00 per share. Options held by Participating Optionholders will be converted into the right
to receive (x) a pro rata share of the Merger Shares remaining after subtracting the aggregate number of Merger Shares issued
to the Cash-out Optionholders, (y) an amount of cash equal to the aggregate implied value of the membership interests
underlying such options (assuming the full exercise of all outstanding Limbach options for cash), <I>less</I> the exercise
price of such options, <I>less</I> the aggregate nominal value of Merger Shares issued to such Participating Optionholder
(provided that such amount shall not be negative), and (z) a pro rata share of the Merger Warrants, if any.</P>

any legal proceedings that may be instituted against the Company, Limbach or others following announcement of the Merger Agreement

the Surviving Company and its Subsidiaries) not to, (x) assert any attorney-client privilege, other evidentiary privilege, or
expectation of client confidence with respect to any Attorney-Client Communication, except in the event of a post-Closing dispute
with a Person that is not a Limbach Holder, Limbach Optionholder or any their respective Affiliates; or (y) take any action which
could cause any Attorney-Client Communications to cease being a confidential communication or to otherwise lose protection under

that is not a Limbach Holder, Limbach Optionholder or any their respective Affiliates. Furthermore, 1347 Capital agrees, on its
own behalf and on behalf of each of its Affiliates (including, after the Closing, the Company Parties), that in the event of a
dispute between any Limbach Holder, Limbach Optionholder and any of its direct or indirect equity holders or Affiliates, on the
one hand, and any Company Parties, on the other hand, arising out of or relating to any matter in which Law Firm jointly represented
both parties, neither the attorney-client privilege, the expectation of client confidence, nor any right to any other evidentiary
privilege will protect from disclosure to such Limbach Holder, Limbach Optionholder or any their respective Affiliates any information
or documents developed or shared during the course of Law Firm&rsquo;s joint representation.</P>
